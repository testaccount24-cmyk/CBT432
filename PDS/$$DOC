  LANGUAGE PROBLEMS
  =================

 THE PROGRAMS ARE DELIVERED WITH COMMENTS IN EITHER ONE OF 3 LANGUAGES :
 ENGLISH, FRENCH AND FRENGLISH (BAD ENGLISH SPOKEN BY A FRENCHIE).
 SO... "PARDON MY FRENCH"...

 NOTE : SAM GOLOB EXPLAINED ME THAT THIS EXPRESSION (MEANING "SORRY THAT
 I AM USING FOUL LANGUAGE", FOR YOU OUTSIDE THE ANGLO-SAXON WORLD)
 WAS NOT UNFRIENDLY TOWARD FRENCH LANGUAGE, BUT PEOPLE PICKED FRENCH
 BECAUSE IT WAS MORE FUNNY THAN, SAY, SPANISH - FRENCH BEING REGARDED
 SOME DECADES AGO IN THE US AS A HIGH-CLASS LANGUAGE. IT MAY EASE YOU TO
 KNOW THAT FRENCH-SPEAKING PEOPLE CAN ALSO USE VERY FOUL LANGUAGE...
