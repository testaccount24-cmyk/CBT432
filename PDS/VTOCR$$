               Some notes on VTOCREAD
               ---- ----- -- --------

This is a semi-automated VTOC zapping tool.

The VTOCREAD program is AMODE=24, RMODE=24, and does not have
to be APF-authorized.

This program VTOCREAD appears to work fine on z/OS 2.1.

Object deck for the VTOCREAD program from member VTOCZAP has been
disassembled to produce the VTOCREAD "source" member that can be
assembled using the VTOCREA$ JCL member.

You copy the panel member called VTOCR1 to a library in your
ISPPLIB concatenation.

You modify the CLIST member VTOCR to fit your own installation
requirements, and copy it into your SYSPROC concatenation.

You run the CLIST:  VTOCR.

Enter the fully qualified dataset name into the panel and press
ENTER.  The VTOCREAD program will fill in all of the particulars
of your dataset's VTOC entry.  You change whatever quantities
you want to, and exit the panel according to the supplied
instructions.

After dealing with the panel, this program, which does not have
to be authorized, generates AMASPZAP JCL to change whatever
quantities you specified in the panel (member VTOCR1).

I changed the generated JCL's JOBCARD to say CLASS=A instead of
CLASS=T.  Just look in the source for CLASS= (not MSGCLASS=).
It is easier to change some generated JCL from the "source"
member, than it is to change the object deck or to zap the
load module directly.

When you run the generated JCL to actually zap the VTOC, you must
issue a console reply for the AMASPZAP job to complete.

There are easier programs to use for this purpose, such as the
CDSCB TSO command from CBT File 300.  However this method is safer,
in that there are more steps involved before you actually change
the quantities in the FORMAT 1 VTOC entry for the dataset.
