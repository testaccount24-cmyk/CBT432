                          XEPHON Materials

Thomas Publications, which acquired all rights for the Xephon materials
from www.xephon.com, has given support rights for all the materials,
up to the year 2005 (and possibly beyond), per later instructions, to
www.cbttape.org.  This is as of May 2008.

Therefore, XEPHON materials republished here, certainly have a right
to be here, so you don't have to worry about using them.
